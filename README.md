# NASA A PICTURE A DAY APP


## How it's made. 

**Tech Used**: HTML | CSS | JAVASCRIPT | API'S
I really dug into API'S. It took longer to complete the project than expected, but I'm satisfied with everything that is live. 

## Optimizations
In the future, it would be nice to optimize a few things
- increase overall speed on clicks and loads
- include user preferences with more MongoDB backend
- add additional search features
- take the preferences of the user and use that to build recommendations 


## Lessons Learned
Since this was my first API app I had to learn a lot about connecting to JSON files. As it became much more clear I started to feel confident using API's to retrieve information.
