# CALCULATOR APP


## How it's made. 

**Tech Used**: HTML | CSS | JAVASCRIPT | 
One of my first complete projects. I was able to accomplish all calculations with simple arithmetic in the html.

## Optimizations
In the future, it would be nice to optimize a few things
- increase overall speed on clicks and loads
- include user preferences with more MongoDB backend
- add additional search features
- take the preferences of the user and use that to build recommendations 


## Lessons Learned
Since this was my first calculator app I had to learn a lot about formulas and placement. I would like to make it dynamic and also make the math with javasript.
